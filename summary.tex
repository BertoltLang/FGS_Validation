This is the summary of the work done to validate the FGS for PLATO.
\newline
The success of the PLATO mission is highly dependent on the stable position of the spacecraft. To ensure that the thrusters of the satellite can counteract any unwanted movement, the fine guidance system (FGS) has to be flawless. The input of the FGS are the pictures of the on board fast cameras. A list of specific stars is used as fixed points. The position on which their light will fall on the CCD in relation to those of the list is an indicator for the position and orientation of the spacecraft.

PlatoSim3 is a tool designed to simulate the output of a camera of the PLATO mission. It generates small imagettes (9 x 9 pixels) centered around a star, which symbolize a section of a CCD of a telescope.
