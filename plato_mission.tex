In this chapter the specifications and requirements of the Plato--Mission in general and its fine guidance system in detail are presented.
\section{Goals}
PLATO pursues the objective of detecting and characterizing exoplanetary systems, including both the planets and their host srars, reaching down to small, terrestial planets in the habitable zone. Furthermore the host stars will be characterized via asteroseismic analysis, which will provide the masses, radii and ages of the host stars, from which the characteristics of hypothetical planets can be derived. Promising planetary systems will be the target of further analysis in later missions. 

\section{The payload}
Here, the used hardware is described.
\section{The means}
